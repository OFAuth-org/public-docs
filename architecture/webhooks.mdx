## Overview

OFAuth webhooks notify your application about account state changes, authentication lifecycle events, and access updates. This page explains the delivery pipeline so you can integrate the system confidently and design for resilience.

## Delivery Pipeline

1. **Event creation** – Internal services emit events when OnlyFans data changes or a link session transitions state.
2. **Queueing** – Events are durably stored in a multi-region queue before any customer delivery attempts begin.
3. **Fan-out workers** – Regional workers read from the queue and push batched deliveries to subscribed webhook endpoints.
4. **Delivery attempts** – Each request includes authentication headers, a signature, and metadata for traceability.

<Info>
  All webhook requests come from static IP ranges published in the dashboard. Allowlist them to avoid rate limiting or firewalls dropping traffic.

## Retries and Ordering

- OFAuth uses exponential backoff with jitter for retries. The default policy makes up to 10 attempts across a 24 hour window.
- Events are ordered per connection. We guarantee in-order delivery for the same `connectionId`; cross-connection ordering is best effort.
- Poison events that fail all retries are moved to a dead-letter queue. Contact support to replay dead-lettered batches.

## Security Model

- Each webhook request includes an `OFAuth-Signature` header (HMAC SHA-256) derived from your signing secret.
- Signatures include a timestamp to prevent replay attacks. Reject requests older than 5 minutes.
- Rotate webhook secrets from the dashboard without downtime. The platform supports overlapping secrets during rotation.

## Operational Guidance

- Respond with a `2xx` status code within 10 seconds to acknowledge delivery. Longer processing should be offloaded to background workers.
- Log the `eventId` header to correlate webhook deliveries with OFAuth support if you need assistance.
- Monitor DLQ metrics in the dashboard; a rising DLQ count signals downstream instability.
