## Overview

The OFAuth API implements a sophisticated token bucket rate limiting system
designed to ensure fair usage while allowing burst capacity for real-time
applications. This system protects against abuse while providing flexibility for
legitimate use cases.

### Rate Limits by Plan

Rate limits vary based on your subscription plan:

**Access API (per connection):**
| Plan | Rate Limit | Burst Capacity |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| Pay as You Go | 60 req/min | 90 requests |
| Starter | 60 req/min | 90 requests |
| Launch | No limit* | No limit* |

The **standard tier** (Pay as You Go and Starter) shares the same limit: a 60 requests per minute refill with a 90 request burst allowance. Launch customers inherit the same Access infrastructure and monitoring, but their buckets are uncapped so your throughput is only constrained by upstream OnlyFans limits.

**Other APIs (per organization):**
| API Category | Default Limit | Burst Capacity |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Dynamic Rules** | 1 req/min | 3 requests |
| **Sign** | 10 req/min | 20 requests |
| **Link** | No limit | - |
| **Account** | No limit | - |

<Warning>
	*Launch plan has no OFAuth rate limits but is still subject to OnlyFans' native
	rate limiting. OFAuth does not bypass OnlyFans' rate limits.
</Warning>

## Managing Rate Limits

OFAuth uses a token bucket system. Tokens replenish continuously, allowing short bursts as long as the bucket has capacity. When the bucket empties, the API responds with `429 Too Many Requests` until enough tokens regenerate. Access limits apply per connection ID, while other APIs are scoped to the organization level.

### Best Practices

- Space out non-critical requests to avoid draining the burst bucket.
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter whenever the API returns `429` responses.
- Track the `X-RateLimit-*` response headers so you can alert before reaching zero remaining tokens.
- Cache results and batch fetches where possible to reduce duplicate calls.
- Distribute traffic across multiple connections if your use case supports parallelism.

### Monitoring Tips

- Watch the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header to know when full capacity returns.
- Surface rate-limit telemetry alongside your application health dashboards.
- Set alerts when remaining tokens fall below 20% of the current window.

### Reduce Calls with Caching

Cache frequently read data and prefer incremental updates over full refreshes. During upstream incidents, extend cache TTLs and serve degraded-but-available experiences while OFAuth restores access.

## Custom Rate Limits

Enterprise customers can request custom rate limits based on their use case.
