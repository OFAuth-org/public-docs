## Integration Flow Overview

Here's how OFAuth works at a high level:

graph TD
    A[Your Application] --> B[OFAuth Link API]
    B --> C[User Authentication]
    C --> D[OnlyFans Login]
    D --> E[Connection Established]
    E --> F[Access API Available]
    F --> G[Your App + OnlyFans Data]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style F fill:#fff3e0
```

1. **Initialize** - Your app creates an authentication session
2. **Authenticate** - User securely logs in through OFAuth
3. **Connect** - OFAuth establishes a secure connection to OnlyFans
4. **Access** - Your app can now access OnlyFans data on behalf of the user
