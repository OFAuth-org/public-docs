## What is OFAuth?

OFAuth is the infrastructure layer that powers OnlyFans integrations - **think Plaid for OnlyFans**. We handle authentication, request signing, session management, and API complexity so you can focus on building features that generate revenue.

```

<Steps>
	<Step title="Connect Users">
		Use the **Link API** to authenticate OnlyFans users. They log in on our secure hosted page.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Get a Connection ID">
		After authentication, you receive a Connection ID - a simple token representing the user's account.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Access Data">
		Use the **Access API** with the Connection ID to fetch OnlyFans data. We handle signing and session management.
	</Step>
</Steps>
