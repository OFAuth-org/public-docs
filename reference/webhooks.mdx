OFAuth webhooks push events to your server when connections change or system events occur. No polling required.

## Configuration

Configure in the [OFAuth Dashboard](https://app.ofauth.com/platform/developers/webhooks):

- Set webhook endpoint URL (HTTPS required)
- Select events to subscribe to
- View delivery history

## Event Types

### Connection Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `connection.created` | New connection established |
| `connection.updated` | Connection details changed |
| `connection.expired` | Connection lost/invalidated |

### System Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `rules.updated` | Dynamic rules changed |

## Payload Format

```json
{
  "eventType": "connection.created",
  "live": true,
  "data": {
    "connectionId": "conn_abc123",
    "status": "active",
    "userData": { ... }
  }
}
```

## Delivery & Retries

- **Retry policy**: Exponential backoff, max 5 attempts
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds per request
- **Ordering**: In-order per connection ID

Respond with `2xx` within 10 seconds.

## Signature Verification

Each request includes `OFAuth-Signature` header:

```
OFAuth-Signature: t=1234567890,v1=abc123...
```

Verify by:
1. Extract timestamp (`t`) and signature (`v1`)
2. Reject if timestamp > 5 minutes old
3. Compute HMAC-SHA256 of `{timestamp}.{raw_body}` with signing secret
4. Compare using constant-time comparison

## Implementation Checklist

1. Parse `application/json` body
2. Verify signature before processing
3. Route by `eventType`
4. Return `2xx` within 10 seconds
5. Be idempotent (store event IDs)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Delivery Failed">
    Ensure endpoint is reachable and responds `2xx` within 10 seconds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Events Not Arriving">
    Verify endpoint URL and event subscriptions in Dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Signature Failing">
    Use raw request body (not parsed), verify signing secret matches.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
