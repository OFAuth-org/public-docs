<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: You need an OFAuth account. [Sign up here](https://app.ofauth.com) if you don't have one.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Use Sandbox for testing!** Before testing with real OnlyFans accounts, use the [Sandbox environment](/setup/sandbox) with test credentials. Too many login attempts on production accounts can trigger OnlyFans "suspicious activity" detection, which may cause account resets.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your dashboard">
    Open [app.ofauth.com/platform/developers/keys](https://app.ofauth.com/platform/developers/keys)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your API key">
    Your API key looks like `sk_live_...` (production) or `sk_sandbox_...` (testing). Keep it secure—don't commit it to version control.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Verify it works:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/whoami \
    -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js
  const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/whoami", {
    headers: { apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY" }
  })
  console.log(await response.json())
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests
  response = requests.get(
      "https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/whoami",
      headers={"apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
  )
  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  You should see your organization details. If you get an error, double-check your API key.
</Check>

## Step 2: Connect an OnlyFans Account

Create a Link session to authenticate a user:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init \
    -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "redirectUrl": "https://yourapp.com/callback"
    }'
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js
  const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      redirectUrl: "https://yourapp.com/callback"
    })
  })

  const { url } = await response.json()
  console.log("Redirect user to:", url)
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests
  response = requests.post(
      "https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init",
      headers={
          "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      json={
          "redirectUrl": "https://yourapp.com/callback"
      }
  )
  print("Redirect user to:", response.json()["url"])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**What happens:**

1. You get a `url` in the response
2. Redirect the user to that URL
3. They authenticate on OFAuth's secure page
4. On success, they're redirected to your `redirectUrl` with `connection_id` as a query parameter

<Tip>
  For testing, use a Sandbox API key (`sk_sandbox_...`) with [test credentials](/setup/sandbox).
</Tip>

## Step 3: Fetch Data

Once you have a Connection ID, use it to access OnlyFans data:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self \
    -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "x-connection-id: conn_YOUR_CONNECTION_ID"
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js
  const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self", {
    headers: {
      apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "x-connection-id": "conn_YOUR_CONNECTION_ID"
    }
  })

  const profile = await response.json()
  console.log("Connected as:", profile.name)
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests
  response = requests.get(
      "https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self",
      headers={
          "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
          "x-connection-id": "conn_YOUR_CONNECTION_ID"
      }
  )
  print("Connected as:", response.json()["name"])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  **That's it!** You've connected an OnlyFans account and fetched data through OFAuth.
</Check>
