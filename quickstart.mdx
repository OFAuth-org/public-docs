<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: You need an OFAuth account. [Sign up here](https://app.ofauth.com) if you don't have one.
</Info>

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your dashboard">
    Open [app.ofauth.com/platform/developers/keys](https://app.ofauth.com/platform/developers/keys)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy your API key">
    Your API key looks like `ofauth_...`. Keep it secure—don't commit it to version control.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Verify it works:**

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/whoami \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/whoami", {
  headers: { apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY" }
})
console.log(await response.json())
```

```python Python
import requests
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/whoami",
    headers={"apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
print(response.json())
```

</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  You should see your organization details. If you get an error, double-check your API key.
</Check>

## Step 2: Connect an OnlyFans Account

Create a Link session to authenticate a user:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mode": "hosted",
    "hosted": {
      "successUrl": "https://yourapp.com/success?connection={CONNECTION_ID}",
      "returnUrl": "https://yourapp.com/cancel"
    }
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    mode: "hosted",
    hosted: {
      successUrl: "https://yourapp.com/success?connection={CONNECTION_ID}",
      returnUrl: "https://yourapp.com/cancel"
    }
  })
})

const { url } = await response.json()
console.log("Redirect user to:", url)
```

```python Python
import requests
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init",
    headers={
        "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "mode": "hosted",
        "hosted": {
            "successUrl": "https://yourapp.com/success?connection={CONNECTION_ID}",
            "returnUrl": "https://yourapp.com/cancel"
        }
    }
)
print("Redirect user to:", response.json()["url"])
```

</CodeGroup>

**What happens:**
1. You get an `url` in the response
2. Redirect the user to that URL
3. They authenticate on OFAuth's secure page
4. On success, they're redirected to your `successUrl` with the `{CONNECTION_ID}` replaced

<Tip>
  For testing, use the [Sandbox environment](/getting-started/environments/sandbox) with test credentials.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Fetch Data

Once you have a Connection ID, use it to access OnlyFans data:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self/me \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-connection-id: conn_YOUR_CONNECTION_ID"
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self/me", {
  headers: {
    apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-connection-id": "conn_YOUR_CONNECTION_ID"
  }
})

const profile = await response.json()
console.log("Connected as:", profile.name)
```

```python Python
import requests
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self/me",
    headers={
        "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "x-connection-id": "conn_YOUR_CONNECTION_ID"
    }
)
print("Connected as:", response.json()["name"])
```

</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  **That's it!** You've connected an OnlyFans account and fetched data through OFAuth.
</Check>
