## The Problem

Building OnlyFans integrations is hard:

- **Reverse engineering**: OnlyFans has no public API. You need to reverse engineer request signing, session management, and authentication flows.
- **Constant changes**: OnlyFans changes their API frequently—sometimes multiple times per day. Every change breaks your integration.
- **Security liability**: Storing OnlyFans credentials creates security and compliance risks for your platform.
- **Maintenance burden**: Keeping integrations working requires dedicated engineering resources.

## OFAuth vs Building In-House

| Aspect | Build In-House | OFAuth |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Time to launch** | 3-6 months | Days |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | Constant | Zero |
| **Credential handling** | Your responsibility | Never touches your servers |
| **API changes** | Break your integration | Handled automatically |
| **Engineering cost** | $100K+/year | Usage-based pricing |

<Info>
  **Real example**: A typical OnlyFans integration requires reverse engineering request signing, building session management, handling 2FA flows, and monitoring for API changes. Teams report spending 3-6 months just to get basic functionality working.

## Platform-First Architecture

OFAuth is designed for multi-tenant platforms managing many OnlyFans accounts—not just single-account tools.

  <Card title="Connection Management" icon="link">
    Each connected account gets a unique Connection ID. Manage hundreds or thousands of connections through a single API.

    Pay only for active connections. Expired sessions don't count toward your usage.

## Security Model

OFAuth uses a **delegated authentication model** similar to Plaid or OAuth providers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User authenticates on OFAuth">
    Users enter credentials on our secure, hosted authentication page—never on your servers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="OFAuth manages sessions">
    We handle session storage, refresh, and encryption. Credentials never touch your infrastructure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You use Connection IDs">
    Your platform only stores a simple Connection ID string. No sensitive data to protect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Compliance benefit**: Since credentials never touch your servers, you reduce PCI-style compliance scope and security audit complexity.
</Tip>

## Always Up-to-Date

OnlyFans changes their API frequently. OFAuth's **Dynamic Rules Engine** handles this automatically:

- **24/7 monitoring** detects API changes within minutes
- **Automatic updates** to request signing parameters
- **Zero downtime** for your integration
- **Webhook notifications** for breaking changes that affect your integration

<Warning>
  Without automatic updates, a single OnlyFans API change can break your entire integration until you manually reverse engineer and deploy fixes—often taking days.
</Warning>

## Full TypeScript SDK

Unlike raw REST APIs, OFAuth provides a full TypeScript SDK:

```typescript
import OFSDK from "@ofauth/onlyfans-sdk"

const sdk = new OFSDK({
  mode: "access",
  ofauthApiKey: process.env.OFAUTH_API_KEY
})

// Type-safe, with IntelliSense
const { data, error } = await sdk.messages.sendChatMessage({
  authentication: { connectionId: "conn_123" },
  userId: 456,
  params: { text: "Hello!" }
})
```
