## Security Architecture

OFAuth is designed with a **zero-credential architecture**—your servers never see or store OnlyFans credentials.

    participant User
    participant Your App
    participant OFAuth
    participant OnlyFans

    User->>Your App: Clicks "Connect OnlyFans"
    Your App->>OFAuth: Create Link session
    OFAuth-->>Your App: Auth URL
    Your App->>User: Redirect to OFAuth
    User->>OFAuth: Enter credentials
    OFAuth->>OnlyFans: Authenticate
    OnlyFans-->>OFAuth: Session established
    OFAuth-->>User: Redirect to your app
    User->>Your App: Connection ID received
    Note over Your App: Only stores Connection ID
```

## Credential Handling

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Your Servers" icon="server">
    **Only store Connection IDs**—simple string tokens like `conn_abc123`. No credentials, no session data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="OFAuth Infrastructure" icon="shield-check">
    Credentials encrypted at rest with AES-256. Sessions managed in isolated, encrypted storage.

### What You Store vs What OFAuth Stores

| Data | Your Servers | OFAuth |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Connection ID | ✅ | ✅ |
| OnlyFans credentials | ❌ Never | ✅ Encrypted |
| Session tokens | ❌ Never | ✅ Encrypted |
| User content/data | Your choice | ❌ Not stored |

<Tip>
  **Compliance benefit**: Since you never handle credentials, you avoid the security audit scope that comes with storing sensitive authentication data.
</Tip>

## Encryption Standards

All data in OFAuth is protected with industry-standard encryption:

- **In transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **At rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored credentials and sessions
- **Key management**: Keys rotated regularly, stored in hardware security modules (HSMs)

---

## Data Flow

OFAuth operates as a **transparent proxy**. We don't store OnlyFans content data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request from your app">
    Your server sends a request to OFAuth with a Connection ID
  </Step>
  <Step title="OFAuth signs and forwards">
    We sign the request using the connection's session and forward to OnlyFans
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response returned">
    OnlyFans response is returned directly to you—we don't store content
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **What OFAuth stores**: Connection metadata (status, timestamps), encrypted session data, and usage metrics for billing. **What OFAuth doesn't store**: OnlyFans content, messages, media, or user data.
</Info>

## API Key Security

Your OFAuth API key authenticates requests from your servers:

<Warning>
  **Never expose your API key in client-side code.** API keys should only be used in server-side code and stored in environment variables.
</Warning>

Best practices:
- Store API keys in environment variables, not code
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Rotate keys periodically
- Monitor API key usage in your dashboard

---

## Session Management

OFAuth automatically manages OnlyFans session lifecycle:

| Event | OFAuth Action | Your Action |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Session expires | Attempts automatic refresh | None required |
| Refresh fails | Marks connection as expired | Re-authenticate user via Link |
| 2FA required | Notifies via webhook | Prompt user to re-authenticate |

<Tip>
  Set up webhooks to get notified when connections need re-authentication. This lets you proactively reach out to users before their integration stops working.
</Tip>
