## Quick Authentication Setup

The Link API lets your users connect their OnlyFans accounts to your application
using hosted authentication - no complex setup required.

## Step 1: Create a Hosted Session

Make a request to create a hosted authentication session:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",

		"Content-Type": "application/json",
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		successUrl: "https://yourapp.com/auth/success",
		returnUrl: "https://yourapp.com/auth/cancel"
	}),
});

const session = await response.json();
console.log("Session created:", session.url);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
	"https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init",
	headers={
		"apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY",

		"Content-Type": "application/json"
	},
	json={
		"successUrl": "https://yourapp.com/auth/success",
		"returnUrl": "https://yourapp.com/auth/cancel"
	}
)

session = response.json()
print(f"Session URL: {session['url']}")
```

```curl cURL
curl -X POST https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"successUrl": "https://yourapp.com/auth/success", "returnUrl": "https://yourapp.com/auth/cancel"}'
```

</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```json
{
  "clientSecret": "cs_abc123def456",
  "url": "https://auth.ofauth.com/link/cs_abc123def456",
  "expiresAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
</Accordion>

## Step 2: User Logs In

Direct your user to the returned URL where they'll securely authenticate with
their OnlyFans account:

```javascript
// Redirect user to the authentication URL
window.location.href = session.url;
```

The user will:

1. Be taken to OFAuth's secure authentication page
2. Enter their OnlyFans credentials
3. Grant permission for your app to access their account
4. Be redirected back with a successful connection

## Step 3: View User Connections

After the user completes authentication, you can fetch their connections:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/connections", {
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
	},
});

const connections = await response.json();
console.log("User connections:", connections);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
	"https://api.ofauth.com/v2/connections",
	headers={
		"apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
	}
)

connections = response.json()
print("User connections:", connections)
```

```curl cURL
curl -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.ofauth.com/v2/connections
```

</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```json
{
  "list": [
    {
      "id": "conn_abc123",
      "status": "active",
      "userData": {
        "id": "12345",
        "name": "Creator Name",
        "username": "creator_username",
        "avatar": "https://..."
      },
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T09:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "hasMore": false
}
```
</Accordion>

## Using the Connection

Once you have a connection ID (like `conn_abc123`), you can use it to access
OnlyFans data by including it in the `x-connection-id` header:

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/profile", {
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",

		"x-connection-id": "conn_abc123",
	},
});

const profile = await response.json();
console.log("User profile:", profile);
```

## That's It!

You now have a working OnlyFans authentication flow. The user can authenticate
once and you can access their data using the connection ID.
