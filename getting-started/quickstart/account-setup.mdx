## Create Your OFAuth Account

Get started with OFAuth by creating your account and obtaining API credentials.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Sign Up">Visit [ofauth.com/login](https://ofauth.com/login) and create your free account</Step>
	<Step title="Verify Email">Check your email and verify your account</Step>
	<Step title="Create Platform">
		Set up your platform in the dashboard: 
		* **Platform Name**: This will be shown to users on the authentication form 
		* **Platform Logo**: Upload your logo (optional) - users will
		see this when connecting
	</Step>
	<Step title="Configure Data Permissions">
		Choose which OnlyFans data your platform needs access to: 
		* **Profile Information**: Basic user profile data 
		* **Subscription Data**: Subscriber lists and subscription details
		* **Content Access**: Posts, media, and content information 
		* **Messaging**: Direct message capabilities 
		* **Financial Data**: Earnings and payment information
		<Info>Only request the data you actually need - users are more likely to connect when they see minimal, relevant permissions.</Info>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Get API Keys">Once your platform is configured, copy your API key from the dashboard - you'll need this for all requests</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Keep your API key secure! Never expose it in client-side code or commit it to version control.</Warning>

## Why Platform Setup Matters

Your platform configuration directly impacts the user authentication experience:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card title="Trust & Branding" icon="shield-check">
		Users see your platform name and logo on the authentication form, building trust and recognition
	</Card>
	<Card title="Permission Clarity" icon="eye">
		Clear data permissions help users understand exactly what your app will access

	<Card title="Higher Conversion" icon="trending-up">
		Well-configured platforms with minimal permissions see higher connection rates
	</Card>
	<Card title="Compliance" icon="check-circle">
		Proper permission scoping helps ensure your app only accesses necessary data

## Test Your API Access

Let's verify your API key works by making a simple test request:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript/Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/info", {
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
	},
});

const info = await response.json();
console.log("Account verified:", info);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/info",
    headers={"apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

print("Account verified:", response.json())
```

```curl cURL
curl -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/info
```

</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```json
{
  "id": "org_abc123",
  "name": "Your Organization",
  "plan": "free",
  "limits": {
    "connections": 10,
    "requests_per_month": 1000
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

## Understanding Your Pricing Plan

OFAuth uses usage-based billing with different plans offering included credits to get you started:

<Info>All monthly plans include the Link, Access, and Latest Dynamic Rules. Higher plans include more credits and better per-unit rates for usage beyond included amounts.</Info>

### How Link Connections Are Billed

Link connections count toward your monthly usage based on their status:

- **Active & Awaiting 2FA**: These connections are billable
- **Expired**: Not billed—expired connections are immediately removed from your count
- **Deleted**: Permanently removed from billing

<Tip>
When a user's session expires, you stop being charged for that connection immediately. If they re-authenticate later, the connection becomes active and billable again. This ensures you only pay for connections that are actually usable.
</Tip>

### How Media Proxy Is Billed

The Media Proxy converts quickly-expiring OnlyFans CDN links into embeddable URLs with extended validity. It's billed based on bandwidth usage:

- **Per-KB Billing**: You're charged per kilobyte of data transferred through the proxy
- **Edge Caching**: Content is cached globally, reducing repeated bandwidth costs for the same media
- **Automatic Rewriting**: When enabled, API responses automatically include proxied URLs

<Info>
Media proxy is ideal for displaying OnlyFans images and videos in web applications. The proxied URLs work without CORS issues and don't expire like direct OnlyFans CDN links.
</Info>

## API Key Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Environment Variables">
Store your API key in environment variables, never in your code:

```bash
# .env file
OFAUTH_API_KEY=sk_live_your_api_key_here
```

```javascript
// Use in your code
const apiKey = process.env.OFAUTH_API_KEY;
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Server-Side Only">
**Never use API keys in client-side code.** API keys should only be used from your backend servers where they can't be seen by users.

```javascript
// ❌ DON'T DO THIS - Client-side
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account/info", {
	headers: { apikey: "sk_live_1.secret_part..." }, // Visible to users!
});

// ✅ DO THIS - Server-side
// Keep API calls on your backend where keys are secure
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key Rotation">
    Regularly rotate your API keys for security:

    1. Generate a new API key in the dashboard
    2. Update your environment variables
    3. Deploy your application
    4. Delete the old API key

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Error">
	Double-check your API key is correct and hasn't been copied with extra spaces. The API key should start with `sk_` and be exactly as shown in your dashboard.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
	Rate limits vary by plan. Pay as You Go accounts have lower limits (30 req/min). If you frequently hit rate limits during development, consider upgrading to a higher plan or
	implement caching to reduce API calls.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CORS Issues">CORS errors happen when you try to use API keys from a browser. Move your API calls to your backend server to resolve this.</Accordion>
