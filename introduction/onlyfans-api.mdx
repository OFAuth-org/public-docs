description: "Understanding the realities of building on OnlyFans' unofficial API—and how OFAuth handles the infrastructure complexity"

## The Reality

**OnlyFans does not provide official API access for external developers.** Their API is built for their own website—third parties work with internal-first assumptions.

<Info>
  OnlyFans has no obligation to support external integrations. OFAuth exists to handle the infrastructure complexity of making API requests—signing, proxies, and session management.

## What Changes (And What OFAuth Handles)

### Request Signing (Dynamic Rules)

OnlyFans requires cryptographically signed requests. These signing algorithms change frequently—sometimes multiple times per day.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Challenge" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Signing parameters, algorithms, and formats evolve constantly as OnlyFans updates anti-bot measures. Miss a change and all requests fail.
  </Card>
  <Card title="How OFAuth Handles It" icon="shield-check">
    We monitor signing changes and update Dynamic Rules. The Access API and SDK handle signing for you—no reverse engineering required.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Authentication Flows

Login flows, 2FA requirements, device verification, and session handling change regularly.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Challenge" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    A single change to CAPTCHA handling or 2FA flow can break all new user connections overnight.
  </Card>
  <Card title="How OFAuth Handles It" icon="shield-check">
    Link manages the authentication flow complexity. We handle 2FA methods, device verification, and session lifecycle—you receive a connection ID via callback.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### API Endpoints & Responses

Paths, parameters, and response payloads shift without notice as OnlyFans iterates on their internal systems.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Challenge" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    An endpoint rename or response schema change can break your data pipelines with no warning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="How OFAuth Handles It" icon="shield-check">
    Managed endpoints provide typed responses for common operations. The proxy endpoint gives you access to any OnlyFans API path with signing and session management handled.
  </Card>

## What OFAuth Handles

| Area | What Changes | What OFAuth Does |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Signing Rules** | Algorithms, parameters, timestamps | Updates Dynamic Rules so your requests are properly signed |
| **Auth Flows** | Login, 2FA, CAPTCHA, device checks | Link service manages the complexity of authentication |
| **Proxy Infrastructure** | IP requirements, routing | Manages residential proxies and request routing |
| **Rate Limits** | Thresholds, windows, patterns | Per-connection token bucket rate limiting |
| **Session Handling** | Token formats, expiry behavior | Session lifecycle management, expiry webhooks |

<Tip>
  **Subscribe to webhooks** for connection status changes, and use the SDK or Access API so you don't need to build signing and proxy infrastructure yourself.
</Tip>

## Risks Without OFAuth

Building directly on OnlyFans' API means:

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Signing Failures** | All requests fail until you reverse-engineer the new algorithm |
| **Auth Breaks** | New users can't connect until you update login automation |
| **Schema Changes** | Data pipelines break on unexpected response formats |
| **No Visibility** | You learn about changes from user complaints, not monitoring |

## Building Resilient Integrations

Even with OFAuth handling the volatility, follow these practices:

### Architecture

- Implement circuit breakers so transient failures don't cascade
- Use the SDK or Access API—don't call OnlyFans directly
- Design for async: queue operations and handle retries gracefully

### Data Strategy

- Cache responses with stale-while-revalidate patterns
- Keep local copies of critical data for resilience
- Handle `SESSION_EXPIRED` errors by prompting re-authentication

### Stay Informed

- Set up webhooks for `connection.expired` and `connection.invalidated` events
- Monitor OFAuth status for any upstream incidents
- Keep your SDK version current for the latest compatibility fixes

## The Bottom Line

Building on OnlyFans' API requires infrastructure you shouldn't have to build yourself—request signing, proxy management, session lifecycle, and authentication flows.

**OFAuth provides that infrastructure.** Dynamic Rules handle signing. Link manages authentication. The Access API handles proxying and session management so you can make API requests directly.

<Info>
  Focus on your product. Let OFAuth handle the infrastructure.
