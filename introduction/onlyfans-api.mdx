description: "Understanding the realities of building on OnlyFans' unofficial API—and how OFAuth keeps you ahead of changes"

## The Reality

**OnlyFans does not provide official API access for external developers.** Their API is built for their own website—third parties work with internal-first assumptions.

<Info>
  OnlyFans has no obligation to support external integrations. OFAuth exists to absorb this volatility so you don't have to.

## What Changes (And How OFAuth Tracks It)

### Request Signing (Dynamic Rules)

OnlyFans requires cryptographically signed requests. These signing algorithms change frequently—sometimes multiple times per day.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Challenge" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Signing parameters, algorithms, and formats evolve constantly as OnlyFans updates anti-bot measures. Miss a change and all requests fail.
  </Card>
  <Card title="How OFAuth Handles It" icon="shield-check">
    We monitor signing changes 24/7 and update Dynamic Rules automatically. The Access API and SDK handle signing transparently—you never see it break.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Authentication Flows

Login flows, 2FA requirements, device verification, and session handling change regularly.

  <Card title="The Challenge" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    A single change to CAPTCHA handling or 2FA flow can break all new user connections overnight.
  </Card>

    Link adapts to auth changes automatically. We update flows, handle new 2FA methods, and manage device verification—your OAuth-style callback stays stable.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### API Endpoints & Responses

Paths, parameters, and response payloads shift without notice as OnlyFans iterates on their internal systems.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Challenge" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    An endpoint rename or response schema change can break your data pipelines with no warning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="How OFAuth Handles It" icon="shield-check">
    Managed endpoints provide stable, typed responses. When OnlyFans changes payloads, we ship backward-compatible shims so your code keeps working.
  </Card>

## What OFAuth Monitors

| Area | What Changes | OFAuth Response |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Signing Rules** | Algorithms, parameters, timestamps | Auto-updated Dynamic Rules, SDK patches |
| **Auth Flows** | Login, 2FA, CAPTCHA, device checks | Link service updates, webhook alerts |
| **Endpoints** | Paths, params, response schemas | Managed endpoint shims, SDK updates |
| **Rate Limits** | Thresholds, windows, patterns | Automatic throttling, retry guidance |
| **Session Handling** | Token formats, expiry behavior | Session refresh, expiry webhooks |

<Tip>
  **You don't need to monitor OnlyFans yourself.** Subscribe to webhooks for connection status changes, and use the SDK or Access API to stay insulated from upstream shifts.
</Tip>

## Risks Without OFAuth

Building directly on OnlyFans' API means:

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Signing Failures** | All requests fail until you reverse-engineer the new algorithm |
| **Auth Breaks** | New users can't connect until you update login automation |
| **Schema Changes** | Data pipelines break on unexpected response formats |
| **No Visibility** | You learn about changes from user complaints, not monitoring |

## Building Resilient Integrations

Even with OFAuth handling the volatility, follow these practices:

### Architecture

- Implement circuit breakers so transient failures don't cascade
- Use the SDK or Access API—don't call OnlyFans directly
- Design for async: queue operations and handle retries gracefully

### Data Strategy

- Cache responses with stale-while-revalidate patterns
- Keep local copies of critical data for resilience
- Handle `SESSION_EXPIRED` errors by prompting re-authentication

### Stay Informed

- Set up webhooks for `connection.expired` and `connection.invalidated` events
- Monitor OFAuth status for any upstream incidents
- Keep your SDK version current for the latest compatibility fixes

## The Bottom Line

OnlyFans' API will change. That's not a risk—it's a certainty.

**OFAuth's job is to track those changes so you don't have to.** Dynamic Rules update automatically. Link adapts to auth changes. The Access API provides stable contracts over shifting endpoints.

  Focus on your product. Let OFAuth handle OnlyFans.
