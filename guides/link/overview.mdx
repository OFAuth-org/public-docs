The Link API (`/v2/link`) centers on hosted authentication experiences that keep user credentials away from your infrastructure:

- **Hosted Redirect**: Send users to OFAuth's secure authentication pages
- **Link Embed**: Present the hosted flow in a popup or iframe so users remain in your product

<Info>
	**Using Node.js?** Our [OnlyFans SDK](/sdk) provides convenient wrapper methods for Link authentication with built-in error handling and TypeScript support. Perfect for building robust authentication flows.

		**Best user experience**.
	</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Hosted First

- Launch quickly without building authentication UI from scratch
- Offload credential handling and security controls to OFAuth
- Maintain a consistent, optimized experience across devices
- Upgrade to the embed flow later without changing server code

## Base URL

```
https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link
```

## Authentication

All Link API requests require your API key:

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Core Flow Overview

1. **Initialize** a hosted session
2. **Redirect or Embed** the hosted UI
3. **Handle** success and cancellation callbacks
4. **Verify** session status server-side
5. **Store** the connection ID for API access

<Tip>
**Billing:** You're only charged for active connections. Expired connections don't count toward your monthly usage—billing resumes only if the user re-authenticates.
</Tip>

## Permission Requirements

<Info>
**Understanding Permissions:**
- **Hosted Mode**: Available to all users immediately
- **Link Embed**: Included with hosted mode, no extra approval required

Most applications should start with **Hosted Mode** for the fastest implementation.

Looking for more control? [Enterprise Whitelabel](/enterprise/whitelabel) mode is available for approved partners.

## Implementation Examples

### Quick Start with Hosted Mode

```javascript
// 1. Initialize session
const response = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link/init", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
		"Content-Type": "application/json"
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		mode: "hosted",
		hosted: {
			returnUrl: "https://yourapp.com/cancel",
			successUrl: "https://yourapp.com/success?connection={CONNECTION_ID}"
		}
	})
})

const { url } = await response.json()

// 2. Redirect user
window.location.href = url
```

The success URL supports an optional `{CONNECTION_ID}` placeholder. When the user
finishes linking, OFAuth replaces this token with the actual connection ID before
redirecting or posting a success message to your application.

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card title="Server-Side Verification" icon="shield-check">
		Always verify session status server-side, never trust client-side data
	</Card>
	<Card title="HTTPS Only" icon="lock">
		Use HTTPS for all redirect URLs and API communications
	</Card>
	<Card title="Session Expiry" icon="clock">
		Link sessions expire after 1 hour for security
	</Card>
	<Card title="Credential Handling" icon="database">
		Let OFAuth collect credentials through the hosted flow; never request them directly
	</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Platform Settings

Security-sensitive behavior is controlled from your OFAuth dashboard:

- Allowed Origins: controls which web origins can embed the hosted Link page (enforced via CSP `frame-ancestors`)
- Allowed Redirect URIs: exact URLs the hosted flow may redirect to on success or cancel

See the detailed guides for configuration steps:
