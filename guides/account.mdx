## Overview

The Account API (`/v2/account`) manages your OFAuth account settings and webhook configurations. Connection management is handled by the separate Connections API (`/v2/connections`).

## Base URLs

| API | Base URL | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Account | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account` | Platform info, webhooks |
| Connections | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/connections` | Manage connections |

## Authentication

Include your OFAuth API key in the `apikey` header on every request.

## Webhooks

Webhook configuration, event payloads, and delivery guidance are documented in the dedicated [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) guide.

## Connection Management

Connection endpoints are at `/v2/connections`, not under `/v2/account`.
