## Overview

The Access API provides two flavors of access:

<Info>
	**Need a Connection ID?** Most Access API requests require a Connection ID from the [Link API](/guides/link/overview). Complete the Link flow first to authenticate users and get a connection.
</Info>

- Managed endpoints under `/v2/access/*` for common operations (users, posts, messages, uploads, statistics, subscriptions, vault). These are stable, typed routes.
- Proxy endpoints under `/v2/access/proxy/*` for arbitrary OnlyFans API paths. These transparently forward requests to OnlyFans.

**Two Authentication Methods:**

1. **Link Connection ID**: Use OFAuth's Link API to authenticate users and get a connection ID
2. **Direct Session Headers**: Provide your own OnlyFans session headers if you handle authentication separately

<Info>
	**Using Node.js?** Consider our [OnlyFans SDK](/sdk) which provides a more convenient interface over the Access API with TypeScript support, error handling, and built-in best practices.
</Info>

<Info>
	**Production Deployment?** Review our [Production Considerations](/getting-started/production-considerations) guide for critical information about building reliable OnlyFans integrations.

## Base URLs

| Mode | URL |
| ---- | --- |
| Managed endpoints | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access` |
| Proxy endpoints | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/proxy` |

## Authentication

Every request must include your API key. After authentication, choose one of these session strategies:

| Header | Required | Notes |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `apikey` | Yes | Found in the OFAuth dashboard |

### Option 1: Link Connection ID (Recommended)

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-connection-id: CONNECTION_ID
```

- Obtained from the Link API once a user completes authentication
- OFAuth maintains the underlying OnlyFans session so you don't handle raw credentials directly
- Ideal when you want zero session maintenance

### Option 2: Direct OnlyFans Session Headers

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-of-cookie: ONLYFANS_SESSION_COOKIE
x-of-user-agent: ONLYFANS_USER_AGENT
x-of-bc: ONLYFANS_X_BC_HEADER (optional)
x-of-user-id: ONLYFANS_USER_ID (optional)
```

- Use when you cannot obtain a Link connection ID
- `x-of-cookie` must contain `fp`, `auth_id`, and `sess` unless `x-of-bc` or
  `x-of-user-id` override those values
- You are responsible for session expiry, rotation, and security safeguards

<Warning>
	Link connections remove the need to manage OnlyFans sessions yourself. Prefer
	option 1 unless you have a strong requirement for raw session headers.
</Warning>

## Request Patterns

### Managed Endpoints

Managed routes live directly under `/v2/access`. Use standard REST verbs and
expect typed responses that stay stable across API revisions.

```http
GET /v2/access/self/me HTTP/1.1
Host: api.ofauth.com
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-connection-id: conn_abc123
```

- Automatic retries, pagination helpers, and validation are handled for you
- Perfect for dashboards, analytics, and common workflows where consistent
  schemas matter

### Proxy Endpoints

Proxy routes live under `/v2/access/proxy/{path}` and forward requests to the
matching OnlyFans endpoint. Provide the OnlyFans path relative to `/api2/v2/`.

```bash
curl -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -H 'x-connection-id: conn_abc123' \
     'https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/proxy/users/me'
```

- The response payload is returned exactly as OnlyFans sends it
- Useful for endpoints not yet modelled by the managed surface or when you need
  a beta field before it becomes part of the stable schema
- If the path does not start with `/api2/v2/`, the request is rejected with
  `INVALID_PATH`

## Response Format

- Managed endpoints return OFAuth-curated JSON with stable field names and
  pagination helpers.
- Proxy endpoints return the raw OnlyFans payload and status code.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 12345,
  "username": "example_user"
}
```

## Managed Endpoint Map

| Domain | Key endpoints | Methods | Notes |
| ------ | ------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Authenticated user | `/self/me`, `/self/summary` | `GET` | Current creator profile, balances, and notification state |
| Users | `/users/{id}`, `/users/{id}/posts` | `GET` | Fetch public creator data and their recent posts |
| Posts | `/posts`, `/posts/{id}` | `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` | Create or update posts with automatic media signing |
| Messages | `/chats`, `/chats/{chatId}/messages` | `GET`, `POST` | List chats or send replies with attachments |
| Subscriptions | `/subscriptions/subscribers`, `/subscriptions/users/{id}/subscribe` | `GET`, `POST` | Manage subscriber lists and trigger subscribe/cancel actions |
| Vault | `/vault/lists`, `/vault/posts/{id}/unlock` | `GET`, `POST` | Work with locked content and vault assets |
| Uploads | `/uploads`, `/uploads/{id}` | `POST`, `GET` | Generate signed upload URLs and poll processing status |
| Statistics | `/statistics/earnings`, `/statistics/messages` | `GET` | Aggregated analytics ready for dashboards |

<Tip>
	Use the OpenAPI explorer (API Reference ▸ Access) for query parameters,
	payload schemas, and an interactive console.
</Tip>

## Proxy Cheat Sheet

| Example | Proxy path | Notes |
| ------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Current user | `users/me` | Mirrors OnlyFans `GET /api2/v2/users/me` |
| Creator posts | `users/{id}/posts?limit=30` | Pass through query parameters as usual |
| Messages | `chats/{chatId}/messages` | Use `POST` with JSON body to send replies |
| Lists | `lists/{listId}/users` | Access endpoints not yet covered by managed routes |

```javascript
await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/proxy/users/me", {
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
		"x-connection-id": "conn_abc123"
	}
})
```

## Media Proxy

The Access API includes an automatic media proxy that converts OnlyFans CDN links into embeddable URLs you can use directly in web applications.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Longer-Lived URLs**: OnlyFans CDN links expire quickly; proxied URLs have extended validity
- **CORS Support**: Display images and videos in web apps without cross-origin errors  
- **Edge Caching**: Content is cached globally for faster loads
- **Zero Config**: API responses automatically include proxied URLs when enabled

**Billing:**

Media proxy usage is **charged per kilobyte (KB)** of bandwidth transferred. Edge caching reduces costs—cached content is served without additional bandwidth charges.

```javascript
// API response with media proxy enabled
{
  "avatar": "https://media.ofauth.com/v1/abc123/avatar.jpg",
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "media": [
        { "url": "https://media.ofauth.com/v1/xyz789/photo.jpg" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
Use proxied URLs directly in `<img>` and `<video>` tags. Frequently accessed media (like profile pictures) benefit from edge caching, reducing bandwidth costs.
</Tip>

## Rate Limiting

The Access API implements per-user rate limiting that varies by subscription
plan:

### Rate Limits by Plan

**Per connection ID or session:**

- **Standard**: 60 Access req/min with 90 request burst capacity
- **Scale**: No OFAuth Access limits (OnlyFans limits still apply)

**System Details:**

- **Scope**: Each `x-connection-id` or `x-of-user-id` has independent rate limits
- **Token bucket system**: Continuous refill with burst capacity

<Warning>
	**Important**: OFAuth does not bypass OnlyFans' native rate limits. Even if
	you're within OFAuth's Access rate limits, you may still receive rate limiting
	responses from OnlyFans.
</Warning>

### Multiple Users/Connections

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Independent Rate Limits (Connection IDs)
// These requests are rate limited independently
const user1Data = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self/me", {
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
		"x-connection-id": "conn_user1"
	}
})

const user2Data = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self/me", {
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
		"x-connection-id": "conn_user2" // Independent rate limit
	}
})
```

```javascript Independent Rate Limits (User IDs)
// These requests are rate limited independently
const user1Data = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self/me", {
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
		"x-of-cookie": "session_1",
		"x-of-user-agent": "Mozilla ...",
		"x-of-bc": "bc_value_1",
		"x-of-user-id": "12345"
	}
})

const user2Data = await fetch("https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/self/me", {
	headers: {
		apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
		"x-of-cookie": "session_2",
		"x-of-user-agent": "Mozilla ...",
		"x-of-bc": "bc_value_2",
		"x-of-user-id": "67890" // Independent rate limit
	}
})
```

## Error Handling

The Access API handles various error conditions automatically:

### Session Expired

**For Connection ID Authentication:**
When a Link connection session expires, the API returns:

```json
{
	"error": "Session expired",
	"code": "SESSION_EXPIRED",
	"connection_id": "conn_abc123"
}
```

**For Session Header Authentication:**
When provided session headers are invalid or expired:

```json
{
	"error": "Invalid session headers",
	"code": "INVALID_SESSION",
	"user_id": "12345"
}
```

### Authentication Errors

**Missing Authentication:**

```json
{
	"error": "No authentication provided",
	"code": "NO_AUTH",
	"details": "Provide either x-connection-id or session headers (x-of-cookie, x-of-user-agent, optional x-of-bc, optional x-of-user-id)"
}
```

**Incomplete Session Headers:**

```json
{
	"error": "Incomplete session headers",
	"code": "INCOMPLETE_SESSION",
	"missing": ["x-of-cookie", "x-of-user-agent"]
}
```

### Proxy Errors

If a proxy fails, the API automatically retries with a different proxy:

```json
{
	"error": "All proxies failed",
	"code": "PROXY_ERROR",
	"retries": 3
}
```

### Rules Outdated

When dynamic rules need updating:

```json
{
	"error": "Rules outdated, please try again in a moment",
	"code": "RULES_OUTDATED"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="429 Rate Limited">

The Access API has variable rate limits based on your subscription plan using a
token bucket system. Each connection-id or user-id has its own independent rate
limit.

**Rate limits:**

- Standard: 60 req/min (burst: 90)
- Scale: No OFAuth limits

Implement exponential backoff if you encounter rate limits.

```json
{
	"error": "Rate limit exceeded for connection",
	"code": "RATE_LIMITED",
	"connection_id": "conn_abc123",
	"retryAfter": 5
}
```

**Solution**: Implement exponential backoff and respect retryAfter seconds. Note
that other connections are not affected by this rate limit.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="404 Connection Not Found">

```json
{
	"error": "Connection not found",
	"code": "CONNECTION_NOT_FOUND",
	"connection_id": "conn_abc123"
}
```

**Solution**: Verify connection ID and re-authenticate if needed

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="503 Service Unavailable">

```json
{
	"error": "Rules are being updated",
	"code": "RULES_UPDATING"
}
```

**Solution**: Wait 5-10 seconds and retry
