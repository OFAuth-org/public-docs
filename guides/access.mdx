## Overview

The Access API provides two flavors of access:

<Info>
	**Need a Connection ID?** Most Access API requests require a Connection ID from the [Link API](/guides/link/overview). Complete the Link flow first to authenticate users and get a connection.
</Info>

- Managed endpoints under `/v2/access/*` for common operations (users, posts, messages, uploads, statistics, subscriptions, vault). These are stable, typed routes.
- Proxy endpoints under `/v2/access/proxy/*` for arbitrary OnlyFans API paths. These transparently forward requests to OnlyFans.

**Two Authentication Methods:**

1. **Link Connection ID**: Use OFAuth's Link API to authenticate users and get a connection ID
2. **Direct Session Headers**: Provide your own OnlyFans session headers if you handle authentication separately

<Info>
	**Using Node.js?** Consider our [OnlyFans SDK](/sdk) which provides a more convenient interface over the Access API with TypeScript support, error handling, and built-in best practices.
</Info>

<Info>
	**Production Deployment?** Review our [Production Considerations](/getting-started/production-considerations) guide for critical information about building reliable OnlyFans integrations.

## Base URLs

| Mode | URL |
| ---- | --- |
| Managed endpoints | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access` |
| Proxy endpoints | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/proxy` |

## Authentication

Every request must include your API key. After authentication, choose one of these session strategies:

| Header | Required | Notes |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `apikey` | Yes | Found in the OFAuth dashboard |

### Option 1: Link Connection ID (Recommended)

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-connection-id: CONNECTION_ID
```

- Obtained from the Link API once a user completes authentication
- OFAuth maintains the underlying OnlyFans session so you don't handle raw credentials directly
- Ideal when you want zero session maintenance

### Option 2: Direct OnlyFans Session Headers

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-of-cookie: ONLYFANS_SESSION_COOKIE
x-of-user-agent: ONLYFANS_USER_AGENT
x-of-bc: ONLYFANS_X_BC_HEADER (optional)
x-of-user-id: ONLYFANS_USER_ID (optional)
```

- Use when you cannot obtain a Link connection ID
- `x-of-cookie` must contain `fp`, `auth_id`, and `sess` unless `x-of-bc` or
  `x-of-user-id` override those values
- You are responsible for session expiry, rotation, and security safeguards

<Warning>
	Link connections remove the need to manage OnlyFans sessions yourself. Prefer
	option 1 unless you have a strong requirement for raw session headers.
</Warning>

## Request Patterns

### Managed Endpoints

Managed routes live directly under `/v2/access`.

```http
GET /v2/access/self/me HTTP/1.1
Host: api.ofauth.com
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-connection-id: conn_abc123
```

### Proxy Endpoints

Proxy routes live under `/v2/access/proxy/{path}` and forward requests to the
matching OnlyFans endpoint. Provide the OnlyFans path relative to `/api2/v2/`.

```bash
curl -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -H 'x-connection-id: conn_abc123' \
     'https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/proxy/users/me'
```

- The response payload is returned exactly as OnlyFans sends it

## Response Format

- Managed endpoints return OFAuth-curated JSON with stable field names and
  pagination helpers.
- Proxy endpoints return the raw OnlyFans payload and status code.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 12345,
  "username": "example_user"
}
```

## Media Proxy

The Access API includes an automatic media proxy that converts OnlyFans CDN links into embeddable URLs. **It's enabled by default—no setup required.**

<Warning>
Your API responses will automatically contain `media.ofauth.com/*` URLs. **Using these URLs incurs bandwidth charges** according to your subscription plan.
</Warning>

**Key Benefits:**

- **Enabled by Default**: API responses automatically include `media.ofauth.com/*` URLs
- **Longer-Lived URLs**: OnlyFans CDN links expire quickly; proxied URLs have extended validity
- **CORS Support**: Display images and videos in web apps without cross-origin errors  
- **Edge Caching**: Content is cached globally for faster loads

**Billing:**

Media proxy usage is **charged per kilobyte (KB)** of bandwidth transferred. **Only cache misses are billed**—when content is served from Cloudflare's edge cache (up to 7 days, may be purged sooner), no charges apply.

```javascript
// API responses automatically contain proxied URLs
{
  "avatar": "https://media.ofauth.com/v1/abc123/avatar.jpg",
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "media": [
        { "url": "https://media.ofauth.com/v1/xyz789/photo.jpg" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
Use proxied URLs directly in `<img>` and `<video>` tags. Frequently accessed media (like profile pictures) benefit from edge caching, reducing bandwidth costs.
</Tip>

## Rate Limiting

Access API requests are rate limited per connection ID or session. Each connection has independent limits, so multiple connections can scale your throughput.

| Plan | Limit | Burst |
|------|-------|-------|
| Standard | 60 req/min | 90 requests |
| Scale | No OFAuth limit | — |

<Warning>
  OFAuth limits don't bypass OnlyFans' native rate limits. You may still receive rate limiting from OnlyFans even when within OFAuth limits.
</Warning>

## Error Handling

Common Access API errors:

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `SESSION_EXPIRED` | Connection session ended | Re-authenticate via [Link](/guides/link/overview) |
| `CONNECTION_NOT_FOUND` | Invalid connection ID | Check ID or re-authenticate |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests | Wait and retry with backoff |
| `RULES_OUTDATED` | Signing rules updating | Retry in a few seconds |
