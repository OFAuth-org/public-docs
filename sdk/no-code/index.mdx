OFAuth integrates with popular automation platforms so you can build powerful OnlyFans workflows without writing a single line of code.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Zapier" icon="bolt" href="/sdk/no-code/zapier">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

All no-code integrations authenticate with your **OFAuth API key** and operate through the same [Access API](/api-reference) used by the SDKs. You get the same capabilities — managing posts, subscribers, messages, earnings, and more — through a visual drag-and-drop interface.

<Steps>

<Step title="Get Your API Key">
  Sign in to your [OFAuth dashboard](https://app.ofauth.com) and generate an API key from [**Developers → Keys**](https://app.ofauth.com/platform/developers/keys).
</Step>

<Step title="Connect the Platform">
  Add the OFAuth integration in your automation platform (n8n or Zapier) and enter your API key.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a Connection">
  Most operations require a **Connection ID** to specify which OnlyFans account to use. Retrieve your connections first, then reference them in subsequent actions.
</Step>

<Step title="Build Your Workflow">
  Combine OFAuth actions with other apps to automate subscriber engagement, earnings tracking, content management, and more.
</Step>

</Steps>
