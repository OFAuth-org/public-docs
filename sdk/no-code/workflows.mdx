## Building Your Own

These patterns are starting points. Both n8n and Zapier support:

- **Conditional logic** — branch workflows based on earnings thresholds, subscriber counts, or any data field
- **Loops** — process batches of subscribers, posts, or messages
- **Multi-step flows** — chain multiple OFAuth operations together with other apps
- **Scheduled triggers** — run workflows hourly, daily, or weekly

<Info>
  All OFAuth operations require a **Connection ID** to specify which OnlyFans account to access. Use the **Connections** resource to list available connections before building your workflow.
