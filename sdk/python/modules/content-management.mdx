## Posts

### List Posts

Retrieve your own posts with sorting and filtering.

```python
from onlyfans_sdk import OFAuthClient, posts

client = OFAuthClient(api_key="your-api-key", connection_id="conn_xxx")

my_posts = posts.list_posts(
    client,
    limit=20,
    sort_by="publish_date",
    sort_direction="desc",
)

for post in my_posts["list"]:
    print(post["id"], post["text"])
```

### Post Sorting Options

| Sort By | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `publish_date` | Sort by publication date |
| `tips` | Sort by tip amount received |
| `favorites_count` | Sort by number of favorites |

### Create a Post

```python
new_post = posts.create_posts(
    client,
    body={
        "text": "Check out my new content!",
        "price": 10.00,
        "mediaIds": [12345, 67890],
    },
)

print("Post created:", new_post["id"])
```

### Get, Edit, and Delete Posts

```python
# Get a post by ID
post = posts.get_posts(client, post_id="12345")
print(post["text"])

# Edit a post
posts.replace_posts(
    client,
    post_id="12345",
    body={"text": "Updated post content!", "price": 15.00},
)

# Delete a post
posts.delete_posts(client, post_id="12345")
```

## Vault

### List Vault Media

Browse media in your vault with filtering and sorting.

```python
from onlyfans_sdk import vault

media = vault.list_media(
    client,
    limit=20,
    media_type="video",
    sort_by="recent",
)

for item in media["list"]:
    print(item["id"], item["type"])
```

### Vault Media Filters

| Filter | Values |
|--------|--------|
| `mediaType` | `photo`, `video`, `audio`, `gif` |
| `sortBy` | `recent`, `most-liked`, `highest-tips` |
| `sortDirection` | `asc`, `desc` |
| `listId` | Filter by vault list ID |

### Vault Lists

Organize vault media into lists (folders).

```python
from onlyfans_sdk import vault_lists

# List vault lists
lists = vault_lists.list_vault_vault_lists(client, limit=20)

# Create a vault list
new_list = vault_lists.create_vault_vault_lists(
    client,
    body={"name": "Exclusive Content"},
)

# Update a vault list
vault_lists.update_vault_vault_lists(
    client,
    list_id=123,
    body={"name": "Premium Content"},
)

# Delete a vault list
vault_lists.delete_vault_vault_lists(client, list_id=123)

# Add media to a vault list
vault_lists.create_vault_vault_lists_media(
    client,
    list_id=123,
    body={"mediaIds": [456, 789]},
)
```

## Media Upload

The SDK handles the entire upload flow automatically: initializing the upload, chunking large files into parts, uploading each part, and finalizing. Progress callbacks let you track upload progress in real time.

<Note>
  **Automatic chunking**: Large files are automatically split into parts. Small files use a single-part upload that completes in one request.
</Note>

### Upload with Progress Tracking

```python
from onlyfans_sdk import OFAuthClient

client = OFAuthClient(api_key="your-api-key")

def on_progress(uploaded, total):
    percent = round((uploaded / total) * 100)
    print(f"Upload progress: {percent}%")

with open("video.mp4", "rb") as f:
    result = client.upload_media(
        connection_id="conn_xxx",
        filename="video.mp4",
        file=f,
        mime_type="video/mp4",
        on_progress=on_progress,
    )

print("Upload complete! Media ID:", result["mediaId"])
```

### Upload Flow Details

The upload process works in three stages:

1. **Initialize** — `POST /v2/access/uploads/init` returns a `mediaUploadId` and part information
2. **Upload parts** — For single-part uploads, `PUT /v2/access/uploads/{id}` sends the whole file. For multi-part, `PUT /v2/access/uploads/{id}/parts/{partNumber}` sends each chunk
3. **Complete** — For multi-part uploads, `POST /v2/access/uploads/complete` finalizes the upload

<Tip>
  The Python SDK handles this entire flow automatically via the high-level `upload_media` method. You only need to call one function.
</Tip>

## Content Workflow Example

A common pattern is uploading media first, then attaching it to a post:

```python
from onlyfans_sdk import OFAuthClient, posts, OFAuthError

client = OFAuthClient(api_key="your-api-key", connection_id="conn_xxx")

try:
    # 1. Upload media
    with open("video.mp4", "rb") as f:
        upload = client.upload_media(
            connection_id="conn_xxx",
            filename="video.mp4",
            file=f,
            mime_type="video/mp4",
            on_progress=lambda u, t: print(f"Uploading: {round(u/t*100)}%"),
        )

    # 2. Create post with uploaded media
    post = posts.create_posts(
        client,
        body={
            "text": "New exclusive content!",
            "price": 9.99,
            "mediaIds": [upload["mediaId"]],
        },
    )

    print("Post published:", post["id"])

except OFAuthError as e:
    print(f"Failed: {e.status} - {e}")
```

---

## Error Handling

```python
from onlyfans_sdk import OFAuthError

try:
    posts.create_posts(client, body={"text": "Hello world!"})
except OFAuthError as e:
    print(f"API Error {e.status}: {e}")
    print(f"Error code: {e.code}")
    print(f"Details: {e.details}")
```
