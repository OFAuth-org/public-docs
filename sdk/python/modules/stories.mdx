## Overview

The OFAuth SDK does not expose dedicated story CRUD endpoints. OnlyFans stories are ephemeral content that auto-expire, and the platform's API surface for stories is limited. However, you can access **story analytics** through the analytics namespace, and reach any story endpoint directly via the **proxy method**.

## Story Analytics

The SDK includes analytics endpoints that return story performance data: view counts, tips, likes, and top-performing stories.

### Story Analytics Chart

```python
from onlyfans_sdk import OFAuthClient, analytics

client = OFAuthClient(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    connection_id="conn_xxx",
)

try:
    chart = analytics.list_stories_charts(
        client,
        start_date="2024-01-01",
        end_date="2024-01-31",
        by="viewers",
    )

    print("Total views:", chart["total"])
    print("Change:", chart["delta"])
    for point in chart["chart"]:
        print(f"{point['date']}: {point['count']}")
except Exception as e:
    print("Failed to get story analytics:", e)
```

### Top Stories

Retrieve your highest-performing stories by a given metric:

```python
top_stories = analytics.list_stories_tops(
    client,
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-31",
    by="viewers",
)

for story in top_stories["items"]:
    print(f"Story {story['id']}: {story['viewersCount']} viewers, {story['likesCount']} likes")
```

## Accessing Story Endpoints via Proxy

For any OnlyFans story endpoint not covered by the SDK's typed methods, use the proxy to call the API directly:

```python
# Fetch stories for the authenticated user
stories = client.proxy(
    "/stories",
    connection_id="conn_xxx",
)

print("Stories:", stories)

# Delete a story
client.proxy(
    "/stories/123456",
    method="DELETE",
    connection_id="conn_xxx",
)
```

<Tip>
  The proxy method lets you call **any** OnlyFans API endpoint. This is the recommended approach for story creation, deletion, and other operations not yet exposed as typed SDK methods.
