## Overview

The OFAuth SDK does not expose dedicated story CRUD endpoints. OnlyFans stories are ephemeral content that auto-expire, and the platform's API surface for stories is limited. However, you can access **story analytics** through the analytics namespace, and reach any story endpoint directly via the **proxy method**.

## Story Analytics

The SDK includes analytics endpoints that return story performance data: view counts, tips, likes, and top-performing stories.

### Story Analytics Chart

```csharp
using OFAuth;

var client = new OFAuthClient("your-api-key")
    .WithConnectionId("conn_xxx");

try
{
    var chart = await client.GetAsync<StoriesChartResponse>(
        "/v2/access/analytics/stories/chart",
        query: new Dictionary<string, string?>
        {
            ["startDate"] = "2024-01-01",
            ["endDate"] = "2024-01-31",
            ["by"] = "viewers"
        }
    );

    Console.WriteLine($"Total views: {chart.Total}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Change: {chart.Delta}");
}
catch (OFAuthException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Status} {ex.Message}");
}
```

### Top Stories

Retrieve your highest-performing stories by a given metric:

```csharp
var topStories = await client.GetAsync<StoriesTopResponse>(
    "/v2/access/analytics/stories/top",
    query: new Dictionary<string, string?>
    {
        ["startDate"] = "2024-01-01",
        ["endDate"] = "2024-01-31",
        ["by"] = "viewers"
    }
);

foreach (var story in topStories.Items)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Story {story.Id}: {story.ViewersCount} viewers");
}
```

## Accessing Story Endpoints via Proxy

For any OnlyFans story endpoint not covered by the SDK's typed methods, use the proxy to call the API directly:

```csharp
// Fetch stories for the authenticated user
var stories = await client.GetAsync<List<Dictionary<string, object>>>(
    "/v2/access/proxy/stories"
);

// Delete a story
await client.DeleteAsync<object>("/v2/access/proxy/stories/123456");
```

<Tip>
  The proxy method lets you call **any** OnlyFans API endpoint. This is the recommended approach for story creation, deletion, and other operations not yet exposed as typed SDK methods.
