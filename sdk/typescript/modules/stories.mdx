## Overview

The OFAuth SDK does not expose dedicated story CRUD endpoints. OnlyFans stories are ephemeral content that auto-expire, and the platform's API surface for stories is limited. However, you can access **story analytics** through the analytics namespace, and reach any story endpoint directly via the **proxy method**.

## Story Analytics

The SDK includes analytics endpoints that return story performance data: view counts, tips, likes, and top-performing stories.

### Story Analytics Chart

```typescript
import { createOFAuthClient } from '@ofauth/onlyfans-sdk';

const client = createOFAuthClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  connectionId: 'conn_xxx',
});

try {
  const chart = await client.access.analytics.stories.getChart({
    startDate: '2024-01-01',
    endDate: '2024-01-31',
    by: 'viewers',
  });

  console.log('Total views:', chart.total);
  console.log('Change:', chart.delta);
  for (const point of chart.chart) {
    console.log(`${point.date}: ${point.count}`);
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to get story analytics:', error);
}
```

### Top Stories

Retrieve your highest-performing stories by a given metric:

```typescript
const topStories = await client.access.analytics.stories.getTop({
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31',
  by: 'viewers',
});

for (const story of topStories.items) {
  console.log(`Story ${story.id}: ${story.viewersCount} viewers, ${story.likesCount} likes`);
}
```

## Accessing Story Endpoints via Proxy

For any OnlyFans story endpoint not covered by the SDK's typed methods, use the proxy to call the API directly:

```typescript
// Fetch stories for the authenticated user
const stories = await client.proxy({
  path: '/stories',
  method: 'GET',
  connectionId: 'conn_xxx',
});

console.log('Stories:', stories);

// Delete a story
await client.proxy({
  path: '/stories/123456',
  method: 'DELETE',
  connectionId: 'conn_xxx',
});
```

<Tip>
  The proxy method lets you call **any** OnlyFans API endpoint. This is the recommended approach for story creation, deletion, and other operations not yet exposed as typed SDK methods.
