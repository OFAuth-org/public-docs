## Overview

The Access API exposes OFAuth's data access surface. Use managed endpoints for
common resources with typed payloads, or the proxy endpoints when you need to
reach any underlying OnlyFans path.

<Info>
  Managed endpoints cover the most common use cases and include stability guarantees.
  Reach for proxy routes when you need a path that is not yet modelled or you want the
  raw OnlyFans response format.

## Base URLs

| Environment | Managed | Proxy |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| Production  | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access` | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/proxy` |

## Authentication

Every request must include your OFAuth API key. Then choose one of two
strategies for the user session that will power the request.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Headers">

  | Header | Required | Notes |
  | ------ | -------- | ----- |
  | `apikey` | Yes | Found in the OFAuth dashboard |

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User Session Options">

  **Link Connection (recommended)**

  - Header: `x-connection-id`
  - Obtained from the Link API after a user authenticates
  - OFAuth securely manages OnlyFans sessions so you don't handle raw cookies

  **Direct Session Headers**

  Provide the OnlyFans session yourself when you cannot use Link.

  | Header | Required | Notes |
  | ------ | -------- | ----- |
  | `x-of-cookie` | Yes | Must contain `fp`, `auth_id`, and `sess` unless overridden by other headers |
  | `x-of-user-agent` | Yes | User agent bound to the OnlyFans session |
  | `x-of-bc` | Optional | Overrides the `fp` value from the cookie |
  | `x-of-user-id` | Optional | Overrides the `auth_id` value from the cookie |

  <Warning>
    When you supply direct session headers you own expiry, rotation, and security. Link
    connections offload that work to OFAuth.
  </Warning>

## Request Patterns

| Goal | Managed Example | Proxy Example |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Current user | `GET /self/me` | `GET /users/me` |
| Posts listing | `GET /posts` | `GET /users/{id}/posts` |
| Messages | `GET /messages` | `GET /chats/{chatId}/messages` |
| Upload media | `POST /upload` | `POST /posts/{id}/media` |

Use standard HTTP verbs. Managed endpoints validate payloads and respond with
stable schemas; proxy responses are passed through from OnlyFans.

## Media Proxy

The Access API includes an automatic media proxy that simplifies handling images and videos. **It's enabled by default with no setup required.**

<Warning>
Your API responses will automatically contain `media.ofauth.com/*` URLs instead of raw OnlyFans CDN links. **Using these URLs incurs bandwidth charges** according to your subscription plan.
</Warning>

**Benefits:**

- **Enabled by Default**: No configuration needed—media URLs are automatically rewritten in API responses
- **Longer-Lived URLs**: Converts quickly-expiring OnlyFans CDN links into URLs with extended validity
- **CORS Support**: Display images and videos directly in web applications without cross-origin errors
- **Edge Caching**: Content is cached globally for faster load times

**How it works:**

The Access API automatically detects OnlyFans media URLs in responses and rewrites them to `media.ofauth.com/*` URLs. You can use these directly in `<img>` or `<video>` tags without CORS issues.

### Media Proxy Billing

<Note>
  Media proxy usage is metered and **charged per kilobyte (KB)** of bandwidth according to your plan's pricing schedule.
</Note>

| Factor | Impact on Billing |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| Image/video size | Larger files = more KB transferred |
| Cache status | **Only cache misses are billed**—cached responses are free |
| Cache TTL | Content cached for up to 7 days (may be purged sooner) |

<Tip>
**Cache hits are free.** When media is served from edge cache, no bandwidth charges apply. Only the initial fetch (cache miss) incurs billing.
</Tip>
