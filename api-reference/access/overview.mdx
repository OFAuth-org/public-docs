## Overview

The Access API exposes OFAuth's data access surface. Use managed endpoints for
common resources with typed payloads, or the proxy endpoints when you need to
reach any underlying OnlyFans path.

    Flexible passthrough to any OnlyFans REST path while OFAuth handles auth and rotation

<Info>
  Managed endpoints cover the most common use cases and include stability guarantees.
  Reach for proxy routes when you need a path that is not yet modelled or you want the
  raw OnlyFans response format.

## Base URLs

| Environment | Managed | Proxy |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| Production  | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access` | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/proxy` |

## Authentication

Every request must include your OFAuth API key and platform identifier. Then choose
one of two strategies for the user session that will power the request.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Headers">

  | Header | Required | Notes |
  | ------ | -------- | ----- |
  | `apikey` | Yes | Found in the OFAuth dashboard |
  | `x-platform-id` | Yes |  |

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User Session Options">

  **Link Connection (recommended)**

  - Header: `x-connection-id`
  - Obtained from the Link API after a user authenticates
  - OFAuth securely manages OnlyFans sessions so you don't handle raw cookies

  **Direct Session Headers**

  Provide the OnlyFans session yourself when you cannot use Link.

  | Header | Required | Notes |
  | ------ | -------- | ----- |
  | `x-of-cookie` | Yes | Must contain `fp`, `auth_id`, and `sess` unless overridden by other headers |
  | `x-of-user-agent` | Yes | User agent bound to the OnlyFans session |
  | `x-of-bc` | Optional | Overrides the `fp` value from the cookie |
  | `x-of-user-id` | Optional | Overrides the `auth_id` value from the cookie |

  <Warning>
    When you supply direct session headers you own expiry, rotation, and security. Link
    connections offload that work to OFAuth.
  </Warning>

## Request Patterns

| Goal | Managed Example | Proxy Example |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Current user | `GET /self/me` | `GET /users/me` |
| Posts listing | `GET /posts` | `GET /users/{id}/posts` |
| Messages | `GET /chats` | `GET /chats/{chatId}/messages` |
| Upload media | `POST /uploads` | `POST /posts/{id}/media` |

Use standard HTTP verbs. Managed endpoints validate payloads and respond with
stable schemas; proxy responses are passed through from OnlyFans.
