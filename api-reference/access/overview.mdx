## Overview

The Access API exposes OFAuth's data access surface. Use managed endpoints for
common resources with typed payloads, or the proxy endpoints when you need to
reach any underlying OnlyFans path.

<Info>
  Managed endpoints cover the most common use cases and include stability guarantees.
  Reach for proxy routes when you need a path that is not yet modelled or you want the
  raw OnlyFans response format.

## Base URLs

| Environment | Managed | Proxy |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| Production  | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access` | `https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/proxy` |

## Authentication

Every request must include your OFAuth API key. Then choose one of two
strategies for the user session that will power the request.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Headers">

  | Header | Required | Notes |
  | ------ | -------- | ----- |
  | `apikey` | Yes | Found in the OFAuth dashboard |

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User Session Options">

  **Link Connection (recommended)**

  - Header: `x-connection-id`
  - Obtained from the Link API after a user authenticates
  - OFAuth securely manages OnlyFans sessions so you don't handle raw cookies

  **Direct Session Headers**

  Provide the OnlyFans session yourself when you cannot use Link.

  | Header | Required | Notes |
  | ------ | -------- | ----- |
  | `x-of-cookie` | Yes | Must contain `fp`, `auth_id`, and `sess` unless overridden by other headers |
  | `x-of-user-agent` | Yes | User agent bound to the OnlyFans session |
  | `x-of-bc` | Optional | Overrides the `fp` value from the cookie |
  | `x-of-user-id` | Optional | Overrides the `auth_id` value from the cookie |

  <Warning>
    When you supply direct session headers you own expiry, rotation, and security. Link
    connections offload that work to OFAuth.
  </Warning>

## Request Patterns

| Goal | Managed Example | Proxy Example |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Current user | `GET /self/me` | `GET /users/me` |
| Posts listing | `GET /posts` | `GET /users/{id}/posts` |
| Messages | `GET /messages` | `GET /chats/{chatId}/messages` |
| Upload media | `POST /upload` | `POST /posts/{id}/media` |

Use standard HTTP verbs. Managed endpoints validate payloads and respond with
stable schemas; proxy responses are passed through from OnlyFans.

## Media Proxy

The Access API includes an automatic media proxy that simplifies handling images and videos.

**Benefits:**

- **Persistent URLs**: Converts expiring OnlyFans CDN links into permanent OFAuth URLs.
- **Zero Configuration**: No need to sign media requests or manage cookies for assets.
- **CORS Support**: Display images and videos directly in web applications without cross-origin errors.
- **Edge Caching**: Content is cached globally for faster load times.

<Note>
  Media proxy usage is metered and charged per kilobyte (KB) according to your plan's pricing schedule.
</Note>

**How it works:**

When available on your plan, the Access API automatically detects OnlyFans media URLs in responses and rewrites them to point to the OFAuth Media Proxy. You can use these URLs directly in `<img>` or `<video>` tags.
