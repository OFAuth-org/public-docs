## Overview

The Link API provisions authenticated OnlyFans sessions on behalf of your
application. Use it to obtain connection IDs for the Access API, deliver the
hosted experience, and monitor session state.

## Base URL

`https://api.ofauth.com/v2/link`

## Core Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| -------- | ------ | ------- |
| `/init` | `POST` | Create a hosted or embed session |
| `/{clientSecret}` | `POST` | Submit credentials or 2FA challenges (approved programmatic access only) |
| `/status/{clientSecret}` | `GET` | Poll current session state |
| `/connections/{connectionId}` | `GET` | Retrieve connection metadata |
| `/connections/{connectionId}` | `DELETE` | Revoke an existing connection |

<Tip>
  Hosted and embed integrations only need the `/init` endpoint plus webhook
  events emitted when a session completes. Additional endpoints are reserved for
  approved programmatic integrations.
</Tip>

## Authentication

Include your API key on every request.

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Security Configuration

- Allowed Redirect URIs: `successUrl` and `returnUrl` passed to `/init` must be pre-registered in your dashboard. Non-whitelisted URLs return `400` with an error.
- Allowed Origins: the hosted Link page sets a CSP `frame-ancestors` directive so only configured origins can embed the iframe.

See the Hosted and Embed guides for configuration details.

## Session Types

| Mode | Availability | UX ownership | Notes |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ | ----- |
| Hosted | Default | OFAuth pages | Fastest to integrate; redirect or success/cancel URLs |
| Embed | Default | OFAuth popup inside your app | Use the Link Embed library for best experience |

<Info>
  Programmatic integrations and raw session data are available by request.
  Contact `support@ofauth.com` with details about your use case if you require
  deeper customization.

## Responses & Webhooks

- Successful sessions return a `connectionId` that you can store server-side
- Webhooks (from the Account API) deliver updates for `connection.created`,
  `connection.updated`, and `connection.expired`
- Sessions expire after 1 hour if incomplete
