The Core API provides endpoints for managing your OFAuth account and connections. Use these endpoints to get platform information and manage authenticated connections.

## Quick Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/v2/account/whoami` | GET | Get platform overview and account information |
| `/v2/connections` | GET | List all connections |
| `/v2/connections/{connectionId}` | DELETE | Disconnect a connection |

## Authentication

All Core API endpoints require API key authentication with the `ACCOUNT` scope:

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Required Scope:** `ACCOUNT`

## Account Endpoints

The account endpoints provide information about your OFAuth platform, including benefits, permissions, rate limits, and allowed origins.
