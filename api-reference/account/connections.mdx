## Overview

Connections represent authenticated OnlyFans sessions linked to your organization. You can list active connections or disconnect them (logout) using these endpoints.

## Connection Statuses

| Status | Description | Billable |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| `active` | User is authenticated and connection is fully functional | ✓ Yes |
| `awaiting_2fa` | User needs to complete 2FA verification | ✓ Yes |
| `expired` | Session has expired; user must re-authenticate | ✗ No |

<Info>
**Billing Note:** You are only billed for **active** connections. When a connection expires, it's immediately removed from your billable count. If a user re-authenticates and the connection becomes active again, billing resumes.
