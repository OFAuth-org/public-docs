## Overview

The Account API exposes high-level, non-sensitive details about your
organization. Use it to confirm API key setup, surface plan entitlements in
internal dashboards, and display rate limits without handling secrets.

## Base URL

`https://api.ofauth.com/v2/account`

## Core Endpoint

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| -------- | ------ | ------- |
| `/whoami` | `GET` | Return platform name, ID, benefits, permissions, allowed origins, and rate limits |

<Info>
  Additional account management endpoints (webhooks, connections, usage) will
  reappear here as they graduate from private beta.
</Info>

## Authentication

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-platform-id: YOUR_PLATFORM_ID
```

## Response Preview

<Tip>
  The response never includes secrets or session-level data. It is safe to
  surface in internal dashboards or admin tools.
