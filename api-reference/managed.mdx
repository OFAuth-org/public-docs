title: "Managed Access Authentication"
description: "Headers required to call managed Access endpoints under /v2/access/*"
---

Managed endpoints are the typed, stable routes under `/v2/access/*` (e.g., `/v2/access/users/{userId}`, `/v2/access/posts`). They require an OFAuth API key and either a Link connection ID or full session headers.

## Authentication

- Api key header: include your OFAuth API key on every request.
  - Header: `apikey: YOUR_API_KEY`
- Platform header (optional but recommended): identify your platform/organization.
  - Header: `x-platform-id: YOUR_PLATFORM_ID`
  - Required when using service-level keys; otherwise used for attribution and analytics.
- Choose one of the following for user authentication:
  - Link connection (recommended): `x-connection-id: CONNECTION_ID`
  - Session headers (advanced): `user-id`, `x-bc`, `cookie`, `user-agent`

```http Headers
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-platform-id: YOUR_PLATFORM_ID
x-connection-id: conn_abc123
```

```bash cURL (Users profile)
curl -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -H 'x-platform-id: YOUR_PLATFORM_ID' \
     -H 'x-connection-id: conn_abc123' \
     'https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/users/me'
```

```bash cURL (Posts)
curl -X POST 'https://api.ofauth.com/v2/access/posts' \
  -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'x-platform-id: YOUR_PLATFORM_ID' \
  -H 'x-connection-id: conn_abc123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "Hello from OFAuth!"}'
```

<Tip>
Use Link connection IDs whenever possible. They handle session lifecycle and reduce implementation complexity.
