title: "Dynamic Rules API"
description: "Fetch current OnlyFans signing parameters or generate signatures via /v2/dynamic-rules"
---

## Overview

Dynamic rules expose the signing configuration OnlyFans requires for direct API
requests. Most applications rely on the Access API, which signs calls for you.
Reach for dynamic rules only when you operate your own proxy or make raw
OnlyFans requests.

<Warning>
  OnlyFans rotates signing requirements frequently. Always pull the latest rules
  before generating signatures. Build retry and cache invalidation logic into your
  infrastructure.
</Warning>

## Base URL

`https://api.ofauth.com/v2/dynamic-rules`

## Endpoints

### Get Rules

Fetch the current signing rules bundle.

```http
GET /v2/dynamic-rules
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "static_param": "...",
    "format": "...",
    "start": "...",
    "end": "...",
    "checksum_indexes": [1, 2, 3],
    "checksum_constant": 123,
    "app_token": "...",
    "revision": "rev_..."
  },
  "is_current": true,
  "is_public": false,
  "is_early_access": false
}
```

### Sign Request

Generate a signature for a specific request without implementing the signing logic yourself.

```http
POST /v2/dynamic-rules/sign
```

**Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `endpoint` | `string` | Yes | The OnlyFans API path (e.g., `/api2/v2/users/me`) |
| `time` | `number` | No | specific timestamp to sign with |
| `user-id` | `string` | No | OnlyFans user ID |

**Response**

```json
{
  "signed": {
    "sign": "generated_signature_string",
    "time": "1698400000000",
    "user-id": "12345",
    "app-token": "33d5...",
    "x-of-rev": "rev_..."
  },
  "is_public": false,
  "is_early_access": false
}
```

### Get Status

Check the status and revision of the current rules.

```http
GET /v2/dynamic-rules/status
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "revision": "rev_abc...",
  "is_current": true,
  "access_granted": true
}
```

## Authentication

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Access Tiers

| Tier | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Public | Stable but potentially stale rules, available to all plans |
| Current | Latest production rules, default for standard plans |
| Early Access | Preview feed for enterprise plans (requires `preview_rules` permission) |

<Tip>
  Subscribe to the `rules.updated` webhook via the [Dashboard](https://app.ofauth.com/platform/developers/webhooks) to be notified when OnlyFans changes the signing requirements.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Cache rules locally but refresh when `is_current` becomes `false`
- Monitor for OnlyFans 400/401 responses containing “Please refresh the page” and refetch rules
- Implement exponential backoff when rules are unavailable (`503`)
- If you call `/sign` at scale, consider replicating the signing algorithm in your
  environment using the rule payload to avoid per-request latency
