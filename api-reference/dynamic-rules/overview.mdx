description: "Fetch current OnlyFans signing parameters or generate signatures via /v2/dynamic-rules"
---

## Overview

Dynamic rules expose the signing configuration OnlyFans requires for direct API
requests. Most applications rely on the Access API, which signs calls for you.
Reach for dynamic rules only when you operate your own proxy or make raw
OnlyFans requests.

<Warning>
  OnlyFans rotates signing requirements frequently. Always pull the latest rules
  before generating signatures. Build retry and cache invalidation logic into your
  infrastructure.
</Warning>

## Base URL

`https://api.ofauth.com/v2/dynamic-rules`

## Core Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| -------- | ------ | ------- |
| `/` | `GET` | Fetch the latest signing bundle available to your account |
| `/status` | `GET` | Check freshness and revision identifiers |
| `/sign` | `POST` | Submit request metadata and receive a signed payload |

## Authentication

```http
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
x-platform-id: YOUR_PLATFORM_ID
```

## Access Tiers

| Tier | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Public | Stable but potentially stale rules, available to all plans |
| Current | Latest production rules, default for standard plans |
| Early Access | Preview feed for enterprise plans (requires `preview_rules` permission) |

<Tip>
  Subscribe to the `dynamic-rules.updated` webhook via the Account API to be
  notified when OnlyFans changes the signing requirements.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Cache rules locally but refresh when `is_current` becomes `false`
- Monitor for OnlyFans 400/401 responses containing “Please refresh the page” and refetch rules
- Implement exponential backoff when rules are unavailable (`503`)
- If you call `/sign` at scale, consider replicating the signing algorithm in your
  environment using the rule payload to avoid per-request latency
